This paper evaluates two proposed mergers in the carbonated soft drink market using a Nested Logit demand model estimated on Dominick’s store-level data. Addressing endogeneity via Bartik-style and BLP instruments, I simulate post-merger prices and marginal costs under Bertrand competition. Results show the Coca-Cola–Dr Pepper merger would have caused minimal price and concentration increases ($\Delta$HHI = 52), questioning the FTC’s intervention. Conversely, a PepsiCo–7Up merger implies significant anticompetitive effects ($\Delta$HHI = 319). Although a robustness check using a Method of Simulated Moments reveals partial pre-merger collusion, my results are highly robust to the implied alternative form of conduct.
